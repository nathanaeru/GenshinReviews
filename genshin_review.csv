review,rating
Absolute Masterpiece i hate the people who gave this beautiful game 1 star just because you don't have the storage to play it that doesn't mean that is there problem.,5
amazing but the fandom isn't amazing,5
Very nice,5
Give me gambling money (primo gems),4
"This is one my first Open World RPG games, and I think I never have loved a game as much as this... The graphics, character designs, the waifus are all amazing, even the story is kinda good... But the updates are dry and the content is not enough when one is at endgame, so hv recently been burnt out. I would love it if they devs can think of a way to entice old players to stay. Also give better rewards man.",4
It's awesome the best game available in Play Store for sure,5
I keep trying to play but it keeps on saying there is some type of error on it it wasn't worth it!,1
"Love the exploration (Except the whole of sumeru), the lore is good, the character designs are just getting better & better! But, u need to give out better rewards, the primogems are not enough! Plus the grind is always repetitive, artifact system sucks, abyss rewards needs to be raised, lack of end game content, and the quests are BORING! The quests are too lengthy and most of the time, uninteresting. Please add dialogue and/or a skip button!",1
"Keep you greedy, even the returnee event you take back XD, but thanks, because your greedy i can totally stop playing genshin and other mihoyo games, thanks to snow break become alternative and other open world game",1
Gud,5
I signed in super excited just to keep getting something popping up saying hint but it makes no sense and it won't let me in the game...,1
Miserly game,1
It is very good game,5
"I love it sm. The story is literally awesome!!! I also love the fact about all the theories you can make. I also love and respect how they have made so the gods (the archons) have devil names from the ars goetia. That's just a cool detail i noticed not a while ago. I'm very excited to visit all the nations in Teyvat. Great game, and i look forward to the future of the game. 👍",5
"it keeps telling me I need to make more space on my phone even though, only 53 percent of my storage is taken up",1
I love it,5
The game does not let me play,1
Genshin could never,1

"Been playing for almost 3 years now and the gaming experience is still awesome. Story line is also good. Just a small request to the devs 😊, hope you guys can add different zoom angles, especially wide angles on all gaming platforms. This would definitely help a lot and also to enjoy the scenery more if roaming the region on a wide screen perspective. Thank you.",5
please genshin give me knave,5
"im chinese, so ye",5
Good,5
The best RPG game I've played in these years of searching,4
Yaaaassssss,5
"While Genshin is amazing, there is absolutely no reason it should be this large of a game. Why does it need 36GB to be able to run? Please do some compression on the app size.",2
Badd,1
Best game!!!,5
Just perfect,5
Rewards could be better,4
Working play with genshin impact. Hindi nakakasawa laroin. Almost 1 year na ako nag lalaro go more power more updates new character more 5star goooo genshin,5
Very nice and adventurous game,5
This game is lovely 😭😭😭,5
"If buying isn't owning, then pirating isn't stealing. 😎",1
"I love this game great story, great character, best interactive voice line, stunning game design & map , good boss fight and best for best character guide where beginners build their character This game is also good for p2w and f2p For spiral abyss you don't need c6 character or weapon to complete All you need is the saving primo waiting until you got your character (16k) primo min just for safety purpose Bad side is the game 50-50 pity system after you got guarantee character",5
Worst game in my life yes it's number 1 game but most worst number 1 game don't download it it's so lag,1
Fun,5
I like genshin because of the lore usually games like that are more focused on like main history events like french revolution and put it in they're way into the game but with genshin the difference it's that they put stuff like Peniheri into it what's based on a real life book from the 1500s I like that underrated stuff of history and I like that hoyoverse puts it into the game I do like the game design too,5
Cool but I wish the game whould a lot smaller the game seems like a trial for 9 days couse of the updates,4
Majaa game ehh 💥,4
Full with adventure I like this game,5
A nice game but some of the prologue are kinda boring,4
Good,4
br ma ma pyaw talk bu သူငယ်ချင်းနဲ့ချိတ်ဆော့,5
Getting worst the more you update I can't even play game now on PC terrible,1
My review did not get accommodated and it didn't get responded to. The issues are still here after all the customer service told me to do I think it's the games problem not my phone or internet. I hope your employees can at least respend to people's reviews and fix the games issues. I hope my review can help the game and potentially other people. Thanks!,1
It's good but it consumes so much data to load. But the graphics is so good,4
Best game,5
They keep removing my review.,1
Best gams everrrrr,5
Ok,5
game becomes too casual. and the playerbase become WK just to discredit all criticism.,1
love it no other words but good,5
"Not able to sign in , i uninstalled every extra apps but still an error was coming nerver downloading ever again",1
"There is a reason this game has fallen to 3 STARS and it's going even lower every time I see it. YOU keep deleting special content and time gate content. New players have no clue. Also, there is no Android phone optimization even tho the s24 is dedicated to handle this game. ""New"" boring and bloated content and dialog is the same. Why keep the annoying sidekick...? Weathering Waves story and characters seem more promising and that game isn't even out yet. Create different race characters!!!",1
Became my most fav game yesss,5
Used to be fun but there's not really a lot of things to do anymore. I was able to reach AR 60 after playing for 2 years and a half once I've reached AR 55 the motivation/ fun if playing the game has already faded now I'm only playing because I've spent too much money and time playing this game.,3
The game is great and so is the story line but I really wanna see more of the anime still art.And i feel like the travel speak instead of piamon since I feel like it would give a bit more depth in the game other than that the games amazing and I recommend playing,4
I love this game! Buti have only one issue make this game more optimized.,5
Its really cool game i love story and animations,5
It's bad,1
I love this game but not farming artifact,5
Best story,5
"Loved it, love how this open world is. It's funny, beautiful, amazing. Could play all day every day.",5
EHE TTE NANDAYO!!,5
"1. The story, characters, world and music - great, love it very much 2. Gacha is greedy, in-game rewards are not enough. I buy BP and welkin but still think that game can offer more 4. Endgame is boring, it's better to quit from time to time and come back for the new regions 5. At least they are making interesting events each update 6. They still work with russia, which means they contribute to russia tax system, where money are used in missile production and you know what happens next",3
10/10 the best game ever that I have played,5
Such a cool rpg game Might even be the best! But it has lots of pay2win options and I'm free2play tho..,5
"won't talk about the rewards since it needs 6 pages itself, but I will talk about the insane problems. Look, genshin doesn't need to try anymore. Bugs that were in during the first patch are still there, there are almost no quality of life features, everyone has been asking for artifact load outs and it never came until the early 4.0+ patches. The recommendations as well weren't there until new patches. So many bugs/glitches that were there since day 1, the strongbox is a scam, fix your issues.",1
Good,5
Played better on pc,5
Nice but how can I change the text language,4
I COULSNT PLAY THIS CUZ MY PHONE CANT HANDLE IT UGHHHH,3
My screen is white,1
This game is great but i really hope they are more lenient on giving us primogems like star rail is getting,5
Cant log in,2
Been a player since 2020. Truly a wonderful anime game. it has so many big places to explore like sumeru & liyue and u can play it 24/7,5
作为一款手游界创世神作，如今却成功教会了我放下游戏出门，很好奇原神策划是怎么做到的？肯定不只是周年庆送三抽和负面事件一出就躺平这么简单吧~肯定还会有过人的技巧比如出那维莱特把环境搞烂然后再继续抑制早已爆炸的数值膨胀吧~肯定还会有出色的能力比如枫丹的主角实力疯狂正常发挥然后说出来的台词根本和玩家达不成共鸣吧~......如今是领悟了一个道理，别看深渊就行了，角色喜欢就抽抽不到就躺，绝对玩得开心,2
"To get stronger you need luck and money, not skill and strategy. Hoyoverse is so stingy with rewards, all the comments and suggestions that genshin players made is put not on genshin, BUT ON HONKAI STAR RAIL. This is ridiculous, why bother asking players to answer surveys then? And you only give mora as a reward. Afk legends has better rewards, they give gems for survey rewards. Genshin only gives 1 primogem for tutorials, afk legends gives 30. You're NOT gonna get bankrupt from giving more",1
This game is the absolute best! But just 1 big problem made this review lose 4 stars! After a play a little I cannot play! It automatically kicks me out of the game! Now I am thinking why did I use 33 GB storage just for this stupid game! 🤬,1
Cool,5
Good,5
"I can't retrieve my account after reinstalling, tried to contact HoYo but they denied my access. 🥲",5
"The overall game play is okay but I feel like this game is to p2w and I'm not saying this is bad or anything I just feel like a lot of the things in this game you have to pay for it. And I know grinding is a thing but sometimes I feel like it takes to long.And again, if you like it then good for you.",4
"Once you have unlocked a character ..there must be another way of unlocking his constellations, rather than wishing ...like you can have character based quests ...with several chapters with difficulty based levels...otherwise its just a money oriented game..where we have to be at mercy of gacha system ..to even dupe the characters which we already have.. Solution is ..for important constellations ..like c1 and c2 or even c3 ..you should give through ingame content and rest of them can be gacha",1
Cool,5
Adventuro,5
the download recourses is soo long,1
I luv ittt,5
This game's storage is ridiculous. 30GB on mobile???,5
This sucks First of all super Laggy and not even playable then the abilities are so annoying,1
I really love this game,5
Nice,5
"Anti cheat system is failing, more and more cheaters in the game, hoyoverse waiting for player report is not helping, there are plenty of player successfully used cheat under radar",1
No controller support for Android. But it does have it for Apple? Not getting my money then. Shady.,1
"An RPG game with the best graphics and the I've ever played, but i have some issue with the switching char that sometimes its lagging, but overall it' a very good game",4
"HI! IM ON MOBILE! I love it, music, graphics, characters, everything, but I have two problems, one IT TAKES A TON OF STORAGE TO DOWNLOAD, I deleted like 5 apps and a ton of files then it started to download, ALSO I CANT PET ANY OF THE ANIMALS, PLEASE ADD A FEATURE SO WE CAN INTERACT/PET THE ANIMALS!!!",3
This dangerous game makes me addicted to play.... But my gacha always ZONK..... 😭😭😭,5
"This game is awesome! Although you have to wait for the download, but this game is really addictive!",5
Genial,5
Gud but stutter so 4 stars,4
"First of all is. Graphics: Very satisfied Game play: satisfied Stories: Very satisfied Quest's: Very satisfied Animation & Characters: Normal Maps: Normal Events: Very satisfied I've been playing genchin for one year and the 4.6 update is well genchin is updating ther map because it's very boring when there is no other maps so I love it they add new map and the New upcoming her name archelino, the events is great and sometimes not great, sometimes boring well well yha.",4
It's really a good game and it's was too cutie characters,5
This game is so scam,1
"I love this gameeeee, even though i got it from Galaxy Store, not from Playstore",5
Wish me luck to get arlecchino,5
Игра хороша но неоптимизированна,3
Needs controller or keyboard and mouse support for android!,3
30 gb ??????? FOR A GAME ??? for real ?? I have 128 gb storage phone but i still wont let a game take 30gb of space. Just be real devs it's a phone not a pc.,1
Great game it's open world so lot to explore.,5
Needs controller support,1
WHY IS SUMERU SO LONG I'M TIRED BRO,4
Super but big size,5
Op graphics 🤤✨🌟,5
Grind so hard i hate myself,5
Awesome,5
"This is a fun game, but half the people who play it are rude and inconsiderate. Not everyone but enough. And it's constant crashing does not help, don't even think about asking hoyo for help because they won't respond. If I could give the game 0 stars I would.",1
"Superb game...Love all the graphics, design, stories and even new journey and adventures!!! Overall it's an mind blowing hella game.. ❤️❤️✨✨🤯🤯",5
I love this game,5
It's a good game 👍,5
"This game has fantastic in game environment and fighting styles. I am not really fan of anime, but still this game story is heart touching from Sumeru & Fountaine archon quest. Paimon is annoying but she is so cute while reacting 🤣.",5
"I LOOOOOVEEEEE this game is so addicting and the story is so interesting! The open world feature lets you explore everything, and the scenery is amazing! There are constantly new updates, and it keeps the game going. Overall, this is one of my favorite games!",5
Takes up to much space sadly and it doesn't give you much rewards and it gets more boring the more you play it,1
I love how the story runs,5
This game is so nicee but it it take a lot of storage from your phone,3
If you have alot of storage...BUY IT‼️‼️,5
The game is good for sure. The graphic really stunning. The combat system also great. But i my game crashing so hard during Archon Quest in Inazuma Well maybe my bad because my phone not too powerfull,4
I love the game so much and I recommend it! It's fun and lots of storylines too. The characters are pretty and fun too play with,5
Its not relevant at all feel like bored and hard to complete the event until end of time..everyone is joining with making and buying the cosplay suit for all characters in Genshin...i think not too many of them will play this game so far..,1
Best Mobile Game by far. Don't get misled by fake reviews by haters this is peak. You won't regret playing this game.,5
This is may favorite game,5
I miss playing Genshin 😭 my phone's storage can't handle it anymore 😔,5
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾,5
Good,4
Noice.,5
It's an excellent game,5
"I have a lot of fun, what more can you want?",5
"This game is not letting me login, it says ""Failed to connect to the internet"" when I literally have my internet connected properly. This has been happening for the past 2-3 days, please check the issue. An early response would be appreciated.",1
Good game. But it takes a lots of space 💀😅 but still fun.,5
I've been playing since 2021 and still love it just as much. I just recently restarted on mobile now it feels nostalgic lol,5
The Best,5
The rewards for Playing Quests are not good you have created so many quests and the rewards of them are really worst . Big missions are worth nothing when the rewards are not satisfying,1
I really like it's graphics,5
Awesome game,5
Good but too heavy. but I like it,5
Shut,5
Its fun,5
"For the ""free"" 4* skin only available in China. You get it.",5
"I'm addicted to genshin , definitely one of my 5 star games , I love how interactive it is and I've made many new friends in co op",5
"It's a fun game with various characters to unlock. It gets better and better whenever I play, it like I'm addicted to the game. My favorite character would be Mona or Sayu. I hope I can unlock them in the future, until next time peeps",5
It's one the best game i have ever played It's fabulous 👌 awesome It's available on all platforms fantastic stories I would really like to have a clan like system or increase the how many in-game friends i would really appreciate that if we can have a clan,5
It's the best game ever,5
I love it soooooo much it has my sister in it,5
Best game ever!,5
👍,3
The game is good and addictive though now that I finished most of the quest the games kinda gets boring (because theirs no quest 😕) can't wait for Nathan and snechnai(don't know the spelling) to be released,4
"Does not give enough primogems, like come on the quests are too long just like their dialogue and then they'll just give like 60 or less primogem, that is not even enough to buy 1 wish, and i spent hours to collect 1600 primogems or more, then I didn't get anything just useless weapons, and also why do I have to make 80 wishes? After my 80 pity I got a five star character but its not even in the banner.",1
The game is beautiful and I recommend it (just be rich),5
"Tbh when I always open the game it's says there is always a bug and i should clear cache, i cleared it but its still didn't work.",1
xhongli ve filuca sddikim,5
"No doubt world is so big , storyline is awesome and game is full of new characters and areas with new updates I download in oct 2023 and from then I play this game daily but no sign of boring or anything only issue I'm facing is they give very few rewards for very long missions kinda disappointing if I compare this to othe games",4
It's sooooo great game it's the best game I played ever,5
"This game is really really bad The company does not care about this game and gives all preference to their second game, Honkai Impact",1
"Nice graphics and nice game. BUT, I just download this game, which my friend suggested me to play. And guess what? IT LITTERALLY TOOK SO LONG TO ENTER THE GAME. Plus, IT WENT OVER THE MB. I dont recommend this game for 300+ MB",2
Beat game ever,5
More chances for 5 stars,5
"Long time player here, the developers don't care about the player base, takes a long time to implement QoL changes asked from way back when, and the rewards and grinding are not satisfying. This game has a lot of potential still and it's sad that the Devs are squandering that and our goodwill.",1
My favourite RPG game ever but the size of this game is so big only that is the minuspoint of the game,5
Bad game terrible awful not good many pixels for an offline game bad don't recommend Btw it's the worse game on earth,1
"I started playing on my PS4, but I usually use my phone recently, so why can't I buy Genesis Crystals on my phone?",3
"This my fav game since 2020 I think, though my storage can't take it.",5
"Its good i like the lore and the details , ive been playing it for more than 2 uears now but i gatta say ,the rewards are ashy. just to do a 1h quest for 60 primogems , alot of time for so little rewards. Lets just hope they change this thing.",4
It's a very good game I like it and the graphics are like omg I highly recommend you to play thank you 😊,5
Genshin is the best game I've ever played in my life!,5
love it genshin impact 💙🤍,5
I like to play this game but lovely my phone still can't open this game because of need more internet quota to download a new server or update a new version,5
Virtual game nice!!!,5
I love this game so much i love adventuring around teyvat and i cant wait for Natlan's release!!,5
Please create underwater world too,5
Didnt win 50/50,1
As a gamer I loved it ❤,5
Not bad gameplay and good ghraphics design!,4
Super,5
"So it was okay before I downloaded the last two updates and that really hurts because I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME!!! WHY did whomever have to go and mess it up. While in the middle of a game it just exits the whole game like I wasn't playing it all. Like what the hell?! Please fix this like asap because I really don't want to uninstall this game. And after you fix it, I'll fix my rating. Okay thank you,....bye!",2
Love it so much,5
Great game,5
Super,5
"A good game with a ton of content for casual players, with a light sprinkle of endgame content. The text is bloated and the difference in play experience between F2P and pay-to-win is vast, but don't negate the fact that there is a rewarding experience to be found for most players.",4
Entertaining,5
"I've been a player for 3 years, had a lot of fun memories in this game. Amazing characters, fun gameplay, beautiful open world, etc. Overall i've enjoyed most of my experiences in this game :)",5
Trash,1
I can't play this game why,1
Good game but why i cannot get any new hero,5
🤩 Amazing game,5
เกมดีมาก แต่สเปคก็ต้องถึงเช่นกัน,5
It's amazing and the graphics style is really good,5
"I LOVE THIS GAME ALREADY, tons of adventures! But sometimes theres alot of paranormal stuff... But still like it, its like adventuring your own life, so fun!",5
I love the game,5
I really love this game it's so fun but I don't like how it take up so much storage,5
"Amazing game...although..it can get confusing sometimes....but otherwise, amazing game...list of good things about it: •Graphics •Storylines •Music •Character designs List of bad things about it: •Nothing",5
4.5 driest update,3
I like it <3,5
"It's a fantastic game , beautiful , fun and exploring the beautiful world for treasures and other stuff is amazing not to mention the amazing characters! But a little more rewards will make the players satisfied and will hopefully stop them from review bombing",5
"The game is really Amazing. But for low end-devices or phone with smaller storage, You guys should do a ""Option"" on what you will only to download, not only it can save up space, but also let the low end-devices play this Amazing game.",4
Require too much storage for a phone game....,1
Good game,5
I love this gameeee!,5
well ypu know..,5
Even with rog gaming phone this game crash sometimes,3
"ya iya seru, tp akun ku ilang, makasi❤❤",2
It was a extremely good game,5
sangat keren!,5
"It's been 2 years since i last played, i really loved the game but i didn't have enough storage for it. I installed it again today on my laptop but I can't log in with my Google account and I can't log in on any other device since I have no storage. I don't want everything to be lost..",5
if you ever play console/PC but don't have time at home. the mobile app is handy. my only problem is thatmy Xbox and Nintendo switch controllers are not supported. and I can also presume other controllers aren't either other than the Apple version.,4
The 5 star rates are terrible,1
"I have my new phone, the Itel P55. I hope you guys improve its graphics performance for this genshin game.",5
Nice,5
"I love the game but the amount of times the game stoped because of my ""Internet"" is absurd.",4
Long Downloading time,1
"Compared to hsr , boring asf and doesnt recieve QoL updates . Its like hoyos adopted child",2
Best game I have ever encountered I don't regret the storage it takes,5
"Frustrated with the wish/pity system, especially when it comes to spending. I feel like if I'm dropping $40 on the game, getting the 5* should be guaranteed. Motivation to play the game has completely gone down as well, it feels like after a while there's no motivation to log on and do tasks every day, and the main quests get too long for me to play day-to-day. Overall, it was fun at first but between the atrocious pity system and the game getting boring after a while, it's not worth it anymore.",2
No need to explain if you play it you know what I mean,5
"Continuing to add characters and weapons has become a trifle, it's better to complete the story instead of this nonsense",1
"I absolutely love this game. I have two accounts, one for each traveler and it has been an amazing experience",5
"Bug background blur photo mode on dimensity 7200 ultra. Changing blur distance not working, its just blurring the whole screen when i set full blur radius. And also please add custom button game UI mapper feature",4
My favorite game but only 40 primogems for a quest is crazy 😭 Even the hardest quests gives only 60 :((,5
"I've hit 100% exploration everywhere including the reputation with 1k+ achievements. I'm dying from boredom, low mora, no end game content and very less primos, you can barely pull 10 every month. I loved this game. Unless you're willing to invest your time and a lot of money on monthly basis, you'd definitely find yourself in a difficult spot.",2
Good so playable,5
TRUST,1
Wonderful game just superb,5
It's fun to play since it's open world,5
good game,5
"I just give a one start because my sister is not doing anything else with her life than playing. Horrible game, horrible sister, and horrible lifestyle.",1
Nice,5
Yippie,5
"p2w game, gambling addiction, bad multiplayer mode, and no server transfer!",1
It cool,5
As low as 5* summon rate,1
fun.,5
Best game I've ever played,5
BEST GAME EVER I LOVE U I HAVE BEEN PLAYING U FOR A YEAR MY FAV IS NEVU FOR NOW BUT I MIGHT CHANGE IT BUT I JUST CANT PULL A NEVU AND I GET SAD AND JEALOUS CAUSE MY SISTER HAS HIM 😔,5
I'll rate this to 5 stars if Hoyoverse gift me Kazuha. -Whoopsie,1
The game is awsome but i have a problem Mihoyo do you have any personal issue with me? From the beganing of the game i never got a single good artifact i farm so much but didn't got a good set please give me good artifact 😭😭😭,1
You guys treat the community badly.,3
Event keep ending earlier than the schedule,1
"Definitely a really beautiful game with good lore but the in game events and web events need to get more frequent because if you're an old player, you most probably are caught up with everything in the game. I'm AR60 and I've completed everything. I don't feel like playing the game except when there's something new out there.",3
Father and Nilou pls And furina for perry and scythe for Mori.,1
Yeah not a bad game I love it the graphics r so damn cool such a good story fun gameplay nice animations I love it nice!,5
I give it 5 stars cuz i love hoyoverse...however Im not in love in adventure rpg,4
It's so fun! I love the adventure,5
Alhamdulillah game nya bagus ya,5
Cool,5
The first time I play this game I deleted it because Kaeya doesn't freeze the water on the temple and when I walk on the water I died. But nothings changed when i reinstalled. How can I fix this ?,4
Low fps,1
Good everything is good in this game no exception 10/10 one of the best open world rpg games that I played,5
The story line and the character design is good and the different region and taking reference from different countries is amazing as well,5
Good!,5
good,5
But the traveler can change the elements in between the battle or in any place and the traveler can use all weapons and wish is so hard the chance is very low and hard to collect primogems,3
This such an addicting game I love it,5
I didn't get my account back but they still really help me so thankyou so much! (FIVE STAR FOR ME!),5
Indian server ping very high 599 Please fix Indian server ping,1
Indtalled it and immediately gsined 10 kilos,1
"According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique D'analyse Cardinale, Genshin Impact deserves a 5 stars rate.",5
"The app is really good. The gameplay, the quests, the character designs, the voices, the visuals, the features, everything is great. I've been playing it only for a month and I still gotta discover it more, but now, it's a good start. The only problems that are here is that it takes kinda much space and it lags, but it's because of my device. Again, the app is great! Really recommend this game.✨",5
nice adventure game,5
Very good,5
Игра просто супер играю 2 года и не каких глюков не было на акке много лег. И обыч. героев все плюсы и не произнесу из очень много.😍😍😍,5
Wish it didn't take so long to download. Then you want us players to buy packs or in game purchases! I'd rather play free and not have to wait for hours to play.,1
I got a quest pending because of which i cant play multi player for months. It would be really helpful if the game could specify which quest I should complete to be able to continue playing co op and to enter serenity pot,4
Not recommendable game,1
I love this game the story mode the graphics and the quests makes it very adventurous ✨💖 I'm in love with the characters and the story mode of the game 🎮,5

"Sh* ty game, racist game wich doesn't care about global Occasions such as Halloween and Christmas etc- the rewards are the worse",1
Explosive,5
Nicee but want more primoo pliss,5

Gw pernah main ini terus menahan sabar kek puasa pas belum belum buka bro,5
بخيلين,1
Lacking in rewards and general player treatment,1
"The game has become routine and there is nothing new or additions to the Primo Games. It is very limited and it is not possible to even get anything that is at least 5 stars, and the luck is getting worse and worse.",2
Game is boring for endgame players been a supporter of the game for 3 years not anymore,2
im having a problem with logging in! i tried restarting my device & reinstalling the app. still no use.,1
Best open world game in the world,5
Wonderful Colors Cool And More( Edit One) Like It,5
Best game ever yaay,5
awesome game....this is the best game I had ever played....but it's addictive...time killing...and the quest are a bit long.,5
Bagus tapi...,4
It is a very fun game. But it takes a lot of space of phone. It really worth it!❤️,5
Excellent game thanks,5
I'm giving you this one star right now because ever since I played this game (2021) I haven't won my 50% and that's so disappointing for me to waste my time and efforts in the end just for a standard character.,1
So good i played this . The everything is great,3
A solid 10/10 i recommend this game if you like adventure games.,5
Wonderful,5
It's my childhood game and it was so nostiligia but when I came back my account was deleted it had my heart burning in days pls can get this fixed,3

"This is one of my favorite game! I love the stories, the quests and the characters! My favorite character is probably Raiden shogun, my least favorite character is.. Aloy.. Sorry to Aloy lovers! And I simp... Let's say 3 boys, that is Venti, Childe and Wanderer.. Ehe..",4
Very,5
The game has a lot of potential but Mihoyo refuses to let it see it's potential. There is no content in which to use the characters you collect because of a lack of endgame and how stupidly easy everything is on the overworld. They lock lore and important story behind LTE's. They haven't updated the weapon banner to be like HSR's which is far superior. Tedious Dailies (let us just spend resin to finish them already). It's been years and they still haven't listened to the community.,1
The story is good,5
Give us more primogems or remove 50/50,1
love this game,5
Size is too big,1
Good Game And Sans Gamr,5
So very naisu even in low fps,5
"I love this game a lot ever since my friend recommend it to me...I felt like, I'm living in my own fantasy world, its cool and awesome...And the cutscenes❤️❤️, i really really love it but the game storage was too big every update😥",4
"Ahem. HI GENSHIN IMPACT LOVE THE GRAPHICS LOVE THE GAME I LOVE RCERYTHING, but I've got one problem, so you see. I was helping my friend log in on my account in a different gadget. not on my phone or laptop, but hers 😊 and i couldn't help but notice it keeps saying WRONG PASSWORD 👹 and so pls fix this mess, thank you, luv from ur fans <3",5

This game was so good.,5
I love this game so much.,5
This is my fav game🔥🔥💯,5
Very good,5
GENSHIN IMPACT FOR A BETTER LIFE!,5
😁👍🏻,5
I love itt,5
Im out of patience to wait 30gb download before playing,1
"why I think it's really bad for Mobile players, cause it cost a ton of GB's. And yk our device gets clogged quickly, But it's a good Game tho. I still have to delete all my Apps to download this.",3
👍,5
Trash anniversary rewards,3
I love this game but when I play this game is amazing like step in real life anime but time pass by it's bring now and am f2p it's h hard to farm the event and primos not enough,1
not f2p friendly when you always lose. it's gacha game but the devs won't give enough fates or primogems to get the characters you want. it's just basically a story game with bunch of waifus,1
I LUV SCARAMOUCHE AND XIAO,5
Amazing journey and best openworld game this is my favorite game,5
Good,5
Best game ever i play,5
It's a really good game I really like it,5
"I absolutely love this game and everything about it. It's really fun and enjoyable there are many events and fun stuff to do but there's one problem I have. My storage is gonna go rip because of genshin impact 😭🙏 which of course, is a problem, but I don't plan on deleting it any time soon. Overall, this is a great and very fun game to play. You can fight in it (no gore or blood). If you are going to get Genshin Impact, make sure you have the storage to do so. Great game. Keep it up, hoyo.",5
Amazing!,5
Not enough resin to do things that needs to be done...,2
Bla bla,5
"Lots of dialogue The secondary missions also seem to have no end, I don't think that's a bad thing but at a certain point it gets tiring, also the fact that you can only advance in the main story when you have a certain rank Of adventure, It kind of loses the meaning of being ""open world"" If you are limited to only following the main mission when the rank is high..., Other than that, the game is perfect and deserves 5 stars",2
I want to play this game but I don't have that much space please make it low space game,5
Mere phone me itna storage nhi hai jitna is game ka size hai 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
Lovely.,5
I love genshin impact but it keeps kicking me out and lagging and it freezes not letting me play and I deleted games to play it and it still doesn't work,2
what happened to my genshin account it happened that i didn't play for almost 2 months and when i try to log in my account i need to start from the beginning from selecting my character.,1
"This is a kinda great fantasy game, for next please gimme some amazing rewards. Thank you :-)",4
Lmao,5
I literally love this game and the graphics it helps when I'm sad and stuff,5
Man 30GB is crazy I wanna play but can't I need storage,2
I like the game also the graphics is sooo good,5
Overall this game is really beautiful and really fun for a game that's free!,1
I haven't been able to play this since I downloaded it and it keep downloading. This is ridiculous I don't have time this foolishness.,1
BEST RPG GAME CUZ OF LORE (my fav character is venti my opinion),5
"I've been playing since 2020, and I plan to spend many more hours on this game. I have no complaints other than not being able to pet the animals outside of events. It's beautifully made with intricate characters and a complex plot and gorgeous geography all over the map",4
Improve graphics,5
The game is beautiful and the play style is very fun. I'm used to honkai so there is a learning curve. But I am genuinely enjoying the game.,5
"This game is amazing, the first time I saw I thought it would not be good But when I played it on my Samsung tab s9 Fe it was kinda fun",5
I never played this I just like hating,1
So high quality for devices,1
Such a adventurous game I like to play it I wait for play it,5
This game is very fun and is NOT pay to win! I love the game but there is to many downloads but it's still so fun and cool the graphics on ps5 is crazy tho!,4
Its cool bro it's good game,5
Played it before. Good game but no controller support for android? Bad!,1
It has really good graphics and it's an Adventure/story game,5
Cool I recommend it,5
Greedy af devs,1
Very stingy with rewards and very difficult to clear. there is no breath of relief the game wants to kill you,1
Nice open world game.,5
Amazing first part the star is good so far,5
"I love this game so much that I will stay until the very end BUT OMG FONTAIN ARCHON QUESTION ARE SOOOO LONG, I'm okay doing quests but I don't want to hear paimon yapping for 5+ hours straight and I also wan to explore thank u (◍•ᴗ•◍) and stop spoiling hsr",5
I like this game this is my new life you know what I really love this game because I,5
"Awesome totally ten I would rate this game at 10 out of 10.It was a wonderful game and a wonderful experience.The open world , exploring is so much fun and then you characters Are really awesome. I definitely would recommend this game. To all the people who like action games.",5
Wow,5
If you play this game get a job,1
Its very good,5
"Tambahin support gamepad di honkai dan genshin plis, star rail aja bisa",5
This game is excellent especially for anime lovers,4
For me it's an amazing game than any other hoyoversegame. Even though I struggling to get a character on the game I enjoy the game. I wish they improve their wishing system for f2p players. 🙏🙏,5
The rewards every anniversary are only getting worse lmao,2
Nahh,3
Potomu,1
"I can't open genshin impact it's show too many request even after deleting app...again I reinstalled it but it's"" show too many request"" What to do....?",1
Great Game,4
Sad to see this game become nothing more than a cash grab. Wasted potential,4
"- It is SO. FKN. LAGGY. No dialog skipping + None, it's just genshin",1
"Good game,nice view, good graphic, but kedekutt",1
Gacha gak bagus bagus :/,4
"Lol, game too boring. Too much bla bla on quests and they're boring af.",1
Suga,4
Best game,5
THIS IS FIRE!!!11 🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️,5
30+gb and no sd card support,1
I play everyday and I love the character design.,5
"The games story is really good, but it doesn't feel like you have much choice and just do what they tell you, and some times you need to grind to go further into the story. The other problem is that most of the locations aren't very different from each other, of course there are some really beautiful ones, but it's rare. The last issue is the combat because you often forget about the elemental system and the characters doesn't play much different from each other.",2
Good,5
Absolutely amazinggg 💯💯💯,5
Two words: CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!!!!!,5
"It's a pretty cool game!I've been playing for 1 month now....and the game style,the storyline everything is pretty cool!! Definitely Recommend.",5
Love the game but i fr thought there was a warning when i wished for 5 to get a 5 star character i was saving for zhongli but still love it,5
Aku menyukainya,5
"Very happy to play this game, the story interesting with high-quality graphic, but why this game gets bigger size by day",4
Its great game but not generous enough,1
Good,5
Good game but need some features like to save artifacts of a particular character,5
"It was really a very good game. I enjoyed playing it. Thank you to the team that made this game, they did a great job as always.",5
I love it!,5
starting was fine but got worst after Sumeru I don't want to waste time watching those cutscenes.,2
Best game i have ever seen yet it give poor primo gems. Getting a 5stat take at least 2 months.,1
I was not able to play this game for long but its graphics are insane u should try (by the way I was not able to play this game because my mobile was not able to handle it ),5
Best game ever!!,5
I like it🥰🥰🥰🥰,5
Love it,5
"Nice game but not to play on mobile. It is not optimized. It takes too much space. I love the lore and the quests, but I'm not a big fan of the events. The co-op events are rare and too boring. There are some solo events very creative and fun, but sometimes it just seems they put some random fighting dg to fill the calendar. If you're more ending game, there are few ways to get gems making it hard to even try different banners if you are f2p.",3
Worst gacha ever,1
"To be honest when I played genshin fkr the first time it really I really enjoyed, but the amout of updates it got it really had my storage, deleting genshin was a good thing for me to do, but I recommend this game to people that have enough storage to fo through, or just download Honkai starrail",2
It's the best gacha game you will find,5
WHY IS KAZUHA NOT COMING TO ME 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,5
❤,5
Downloaded the app again to give it another go... I don't regret much but what the heck was I thinking? This game has had zero improvement on playability and I don't mean that it doesn't work but you gotta pay to enjoy and even then you still end up with the short stick when you are unable to get powerful enough characters and equip... think I'll stick to WOTV FFBE over this rubbish where you potentially get what you work/pull for.,1
"It was great and all, but when I got into my friends ac to let me borrow it, my friend couldn't log into my account. Please fix it AND STOP MAKING THE LOADING SO SLOW😭😭😭💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥",4
I am lisa main,5
"Do NOT play this game I played this game for over a year and is now ar55, I am currently eternally trapped in farming artifacts with no escape, Don't play the game to avoid this fate",5
I lost my accounts bc I bought a new phone but I still like the game so muchhhhh,5
Not a bad game,4
"absolutely awful character writing, with some characters turning into fanservice material while others becoming gag reliefs so they wouldn't have to make meaningful events. whoever is writing the stories should be sternly talked to. the first patches were so good, but now i see characters i like getting sold to fanservice to get that sweet sweet cash from delusional players. i miss pre-inazuma genshin, when the writing made sense and lores weren't changed for fanservice.",1
The game is crashing alot!!! It's not even opening!!!,1
More primogems.,3
Pet me. Tell u something if I get during or Raiden or nahida I will love u genshine impact and I like the co-op mode and the cut sceens,5
"Not alot of endgame but they will add more in 4.7, the only gripe is some weapons will be near impossible to obtain like an Hp% sword. So far they only have had one 4 star hp sword and it was for a limited time. Also the game is super grindy you will have to log in every day maybe even twice if you want to progress. The artifact system is the worst you can go months without getting 2 EM ones from a set. So if you want to play nahida or kazuha your in pain. Takes one week to level up 1 artifact!!",5
Storage besar cam gampang. Buat cepat rosak fon je.,1
woi hoyo nopal gw mana🤬,5
miskin bansos ajg,3
I sacrificed my phones storage for this better be good,5
Game nya seru,5
"Hello dear hoyoverse Ltd. I almost agree with the rest of reviews recently posted, your start was wonderful, but it is really starting to feel too repetitive, the whole game overally Is mesmerizing and no doubt in that, but please put more areas quest to explore in your future updates including archon quest, it's been a while since your last archon quest updated, we players difinitely appreciate more opportunity to recieve primogems freely and please and please, set up free control bottom.🙏",4
ชอบเนื้อเรื่องมากเลย,5
Best,5
Its a really good game but its very hard to get primogems to get charctars,3
It's ok but it takes up too much storage so yeah the only thing I would have like ia that if it takes just a bit less of storage but overall it's pretty ok,4
اخس شركه في الارض امسحوا العبه ياحراميه,1
"Developing characters is very difficult, and my account is weak, but the game is wonderful, but the number of premojimes is small, and I cannot get many characters, and I only have three Five Stars. I hope you improve the number of premojimes, thank you.",5
🤩🤩,5
"This game has been good,this was the first RPG game ive ever played but I've been having technical issues,my phone has been like blacking out whenever I try to log in on genshin..😓can someone help me fix this issue?",4
Too many characters to control. Why not just make a game where you are to learn a skill rather than summoning another character?,5
Best,5
This game become bad and bad day by day I am playing now from a year aside from story which update like 1 time in 6 weeks there is nothing else to do what a complete dogshit game,1
ill give 5 star if you make me win my 50/50😔❤️,3
I really the game because its test my temper to the limits,5
ужасная игра я играю в нее третий год меня задрало пипец,1
"One of the best game ever. Characters, Theme Music, Story line, Quests, Animations, Events and so far. One of the Best choice I took. The storage is the tricky part but it is worth spending✨🥰❤️. Awaiting for the story to end.",5
"game was fun during its initial stage, lots to explore, characters to build, etc. After a while, the game is rather repetitive. Your team can easily kills anything in the overworld. Abbyss is the place to test out your build. to summarize, basically there is not much incentive to play after you have done everything, apart from testing out new characters, building them again for some time. I have been playing this game religiously for over a year (6months+ on phone, the rest on laptop)",4
I have played this game before but not on this device before after like a hour its was only 2% don't loadinging,1
"Pretty amazing, the games visuals are really good I love the main story quests and the character designs are amazing. Voices are soo pretty and the feeling you get after finally winning your gacha pulls is heaven fr",5
"i can't play it today, the game keep closing or having a bug. Please fix it",2
I keep being kicked and told there is a bug and that I need to update the game even though it's all updated.,4
So I tried playing but every time I try to join it says not enough space so 1 star,1
no controller supports 🤬 apple,1
🔵🫸🫷🔴 🫴 =====🟣,5
excellent,5
the best game ever!!!,5
"Devs are absolutely clueless about the size of this game. Look at their responses. I ended up downloading this on my new Alienware laptop and it is STILL TOO LARGE. It takes a half hour to download new content. I never play bc I don't want to wait that long. Review from a year ago, when I tried to download on mobile: 19 GB?!? Never finished downloading. That's ridiculous.",1
Bad,1
Graphics is Wonderful and I can explore freely,5
I love this game! It's so intresting and magical!!! You can do quest and different battles!! You can even fight those weird blob monsters. This game has boosted my confidence with defense and learning! I LOVE GENSHIN IMPACTTTTTTTT,5
Furina rerun when?,5
I love this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘😘😛🐷🐷💒💒🎉🎉☺☺☺🍌🍞🐷🐷🎯😥😒❤😍😛🌄😔😜😃😘,5
"Thought the hype of this game would go down after a few years yet it remains strong with the constant updates, glad I was part of the early group to register for it when it came out. Keep up the good work Devs 👍",5
You'll be so much happier without this game in your life trust me,2
"It's not a game anymore. Unskippable cutscenes, lack of advance, disturbing gameplay mechanics annoy me. The game doesn't give me a change to improve my characters. Everything is so complicated, I play video games to have fun not to live. The game feels like a chore!",2
guys.... pls give me arlecchino at low pity..... i need her so bad......... pls give me tighnari...... then 1 pull arlecchino.....................,4
Game is good but they are not giving us character while we are wishing it takes more time,1
"Playing this game for a while then I stopped playing it because I get bored....now i miss the game, when I log back into it, my account started back to 0.... so I just totally uninstall it. what a waste.",1
Gameplay has needed a good update since 2.0. Pretty much still the same with a few variations.,3
Its great but it keeps having issues when I try to boot the game,4
Fun game but it sometimes takes long to load,4
The game wont start even if I got big storage it keeps saying I need more storage,1
واقعا خیلی خوبه ولی ای کاش حجمش کمتر بود اینطوری راحت تر میشد روی گوشی بازیش کرد شاید تا اخر گنشین نشه روی مبایل بازی کرد بهتره روی کامپیوتر باشه🥲,1
ممتع,5
I enjoy the lore and the art style it's an amazing open world game,5
"In the previous few days the game just crashes out of nowhere, and it's worse everyday, I reinstalled it and waited for few hours to download thinking it would help, but it's just worse. I would think it's bc of the phone even though it's recently bought, but I saw other people complaining about this issue and this needs to be fixed because I literally CANNOT play the game. As soon as I enter, it lags and crash immediately, you can't even do 1 single commission.",1
I just love this game so much,5
Love it,5
Best anime style mmorpg,5
I will give an one star because that consumes so much data if we don't have internet piz fix this😡😡😡 And 1 thing tell every anime game creator fix the data consumer ok?,1
"Great lore. But small rewards, gameplay is a open world,",5
Because it didn't let me play and it sayed that you needed to download something so I didn't like it!,1
Best game 💜,5
Its just too hard+ too complicated. (It is beautiful though),2
I haven't play this game before that i was totally crying i really really wanted to play this game,5
It's a fun adventure game like a mobile version of Zelda,5

"No need to explain, best game 🤝",5
Theare is a lot of traps in the game and some black people but only some so it's not a big deal🗿,1
bad,1
Super,5
"I really love this game and fully recommend it. But still,I have to say that farming and getting character should be easier, and I tried Honkai Star rail and it's easier (to farm,and getting characters). But this doesn't mean genshin isn't good (I love genshin's voices,characters, graphics, etc..)from my phone I can't get daily rewards (I hope in 4.6 I'll get them) so I hope hoyo's staff read this and somehow let me get daily rewards too cuz I want those primos (I'm too lazy to get primos).",5
"So,, So",3
Gila keren abiss dah bang!!,5
Can you add how much pitty please like 0/90 cuz I can't remember sometimes how much I used to get my 50/50 character.,4
W GAME,1
when 4.6 waiting for arlecchino,5
They won't listen to player outside of mainland china,1
"I just think that this game is a bit too much for my phone, the space needed is too much.",3
The fontaine story is bad. So many plotholes and inconsistences that they ruin some characters like Neuvillette.,2
Game is very good much better than I thought full game size 31 GB 👍,5
"Help, I'm AR 60. Save me from tnhis hell. Play at your own risk. You might spend money even if you say you won't.",5
❤️‍🩹,5
Bad game I didn't play at all,1
My game crashes literally ever 2 seconds,1

It's The Best Anime Rpg style game I've ever Played.,5
"This game is indeed really pretty, the landscape and characters, I have nothing bad about this review. It's a great game!",5
"not bad, I only gives 3 stars bcs of the size is large",3

Stuck at Too many Requests pls try agad I already deleted and I don't use any cheats but I have I lot of Gmail that's all I can't even play it anymore its frustrating that I already downloaded the game resources 4 times and I have an average internet so it's slow and my patients is going down pls fix it Thanks Now I will try to download all the resources hopefully it is fix,1
"This is one of my Google accounts,I thought the problem in the game are just minors,I had to create another account through my other google account to start again because I can't finish some quest in my first account due to inconvenience of finishing quests please don't allow the game to open too many quest that can disrupt other quests specially in the Archon and Story Quests,there's also that one quest which I accidentally finished without navigating I can't finish anymore",4
Please fix its not working,5
Love it so far,5
need controller support for android,3
"I ALREADY GOT GANYUU, THANKSS. now gimme hu tao and wanderer",5

Nice game,5
It was good,5
I love this game,5
"It's a good game even though is has a lot of storage taken, Its kinda laggy and make the wishes cheap",4
"pls add a skip button, I'm getting tired of tapping all the time ☺️🌷🌷",5
It's just good,5
Gacha trash.,1
The game is ok . But it has no content no fun event s few rewords no goals to accomplish after 2 month of playing for 90% of ppl . Over all it not that great of the game storyline is a 6/10 combat is 7/10 events 2/10 no end game content or even mid game content,2
Very amazing but the shards are getting very much slowly,5
"lose qiqi pity 80, neuvilete pity 75 🤡.",1
"A lot of players, are just gotcha addicts. Its a gotcha yes but it's an RPG, know what rpg mean, dont ask for skip dialogue this and that. That's what the game is. You're all about meta, and just complaining on things you dont like. You're not even playing the game as it is. RPGs are known for their stories amd that's what made them great, play the game by reading and doing quest and READ. Other things in game are just bonuses, just play the game as it is.",5
"Everything else is nice but, you'll spend your lifetime but won't get a nice artifact set. Artifacts rng should be optimised, it makes it so annoying to go daily in the same domain and get nothing gud in return.",1
"I really love the characters, Game exploration, atmosphere and especially the story and Lore would love to play this all day, all night no sleep",5
It's cool! I want to make a request for the new update pls add this so in the game aether or lunime is killed by their sister or brother but turns out they are clones of the original two and the original aether or lunime are locked up and weren't killed like the other clones who tried to kill their original because of the memory fragment they got from the twins when created and only wanted revenge on those who destroyed their home.pls I like this game pls add this in the game I am very happy😊,5
Super graphics,5
Best exploring adventure and RPGs game I have ever played I give this a 5 because the game is very qualified,5
It's a 30gb space consumption what the heck is this game large files,1
Man f this I'll go play minecraft,1
Suppperrrr,5
Bad game,1
Pay2win game,1
It's a best game ever,5
I'm sick of seeing ads for this everywhere when I already have it downloaded. Have so much money into and cant even recover my account on my ps4,1
"I'm done with this game, not gonna burn any more money. Thank you for giving me 2 stupid swords instead of Neuvillette weapon. WAKE UP ! EVERYONE IS HATING THIS GAME !",1
Game js good but it freezes again and again. Please do something or provide me solution.,5
"I would recommend this game because of the graphics or characters, but there is a reason why it's not too good because I've tried to play with my friend but he said that the account he uses is asia.Mine is america, when we tried everything we can't multiplayer. So i recommend to put a cross server where people can play with different regions.. Thanks!!",4
"The graphics are great and storylines are important, but it takes a lonnngg time to load and then unfortunately undo s the progress you've made, also when I started the app, it approx took me 8AM before I went to eat DINNER AND THEN it loaded after like 6 at the evening. Bro. I absolutely hate this now",1
"Please give us a unique anniversary item or etc. that make this anniversary more memorable/special, and to make us feel more appreciated or proud from playing this game. A unique item that can make the players present at this timeline feel nostalgic whenever we look at it in the future, and that we can boast it to the upcoming new players in the future. Although It's fine if not. TY for creating an Amazing Game, Belated Happy Anniversary. Hope we get some fun new events ^^",1
Very good Game,5
mihoyo does not give us more wishes than honkai PLS MIHOYO GIVE US MORE PRIMOS,3
Like it I love it!!!!!,5
Very good game,5
It is more than amazing and I wish it could be more amazing,5
10/10 love it all <3 ♡♡,5
Nice,5
It is lagging,1
Sneaking around early game is too hard,1
It was loading it takes an hour but I like it,3
"It was fantastic at first but after 3 years of playing it, doing the same thing everyday. I got bored and gave up on this game and switched to HSR",3
I love this game 😍,5
Give tao year 3 lol but grinding is 💀. Update: Honkai impact 3d is better,3
"best game I've ever played since the time I ever tried a mobile game in any form,but please listen,the problem while in the fight,the obstacles will block our vision,sometimes don't even know if I'm hitting my target,trees grasses rocks anything can block our vision while fighting,it destroy our skills on a gameplay, please fix this,any other problems in the game are just minor,though this game is rooted in Paganism,the gameplay is action and problem solving type of quests,can increase brain IQ",5
great game but lack of updates 👍,4
"I've played this game for 100s of hours and I can say I only enjoyed a few hours of gameplay. The characters, graphics, art, and cutscenes in this game is beautiful. Collecting characters is a nightmare unless you have 60-120 dollars everytime you're interested in a character. It takes hours of bosses, grinding, and collecting just to build a single character so no you can't play with the character right after getting it. The quests are dreadful. 500 letters is not enough to explain how this gam",1
I like the game but you should be able to lower the world level more than once because as a new I just worked on my adventure rank and now I can't really beat anything. The game also needs a selling system like breath of the wild where can sell anything you're not going to use to get Mora easier because it a big part of the game as you need is level and ascend character plus you also need it to level up weapons and artifacts.,3
"This game has beautiful graphics, characters, scenes, and has great storyline too! I've been playing a lot since I joined like, two months ago maybe? I've been hooked ever since, this game is just so much fun! I only wish there was more to do in co-op mode.",5
"Okay, I think this is the most fun game ever, tbh but the only reason I gave it 3 stars I it uses a lot of space, which I had no choice but to uninstall it. My phone keeps on chasing it really hurt me to uninstall the game it's not even my own device , but I'm going to install it again very soon, so keep up with the work till then I will be using star hail.....(also a good game btw)",3
The game was good but so glitchy the first time I ever played it was on my computer and on my computer it was glitchy but on my phone it won't even load and I deleted apps to make your room,1
This is very good like ps5 kinda good,5
"Why resolution is very low on my phone? Even after seting it the highest possible in the settings, still it feels low. I play on Snapdragon 730 powered phone.",5
"Hell naw, stingiest gacha ever",1
It's graphic is best and story line best and for my opinion 5star game and I am playing this for second time from restart,5
"Genwhin Impact is the best , I absolutely love the game.",5
"This is a very nice game, most the quests were fun and challenging. I would recommend for friends",5
For version 4.6 could it have the data be in MB?.,1
"Before I start, I need to say, that I absolutely love(d) This game. I loved everything about it. And still, today was the day I deleted genshin impact. On April 24rd 2022 I believe was the day I downloaded genshin. I loved playing, I was addicted to the game but with time it just got too much. The events are super fun to play, the stories are a but tiring but also interesting. Building characters was one of my favourites. But everything has an end. Goodbye genshin, thanks for this fun time❤️🙏🏼",5
"Love this game beautiful, fun and very addictive, not to difficult to learn or understand been playing 78 days strong now and I already got several 5 stars, I would recommend anyone give this game a go. Reward system not to good its a pain to collect primos, updated at 542 days of playing",4
"Best mobile game on the market if your device can handle it and you play for the story. Otherwise, good luck on your pulls",5
I love it but when I play it kinda glitch,5
Gets stuck on a white screen after door after you've spent 30GB of download time. Thanks greatest waste of my time,1
A thirst trap. Not recommended. And above that if you play more than 30 minutes a day you will be FORCED to pay to play. Otherwise you can't visit dungeons and loot items you need,1
I like this game,5
Great game with good graphics and content but I can't progress quickly because of it's repetetive gameplay content. Even though I completed many missions they keep appearing everytime I pass through that area. I love this game but it would be more awesome if it can adopt gameplay like gta game in which the missions won't repeat and completely disappears and navigate to other missions.,3
Really nice game,5
Good,5
Good game 👍,5
Cuz i do,1
I can't believe I was missing out on this for a long time. That 30 GB storage loss was worth it.,5
Great game,5
Please add controller support on android. It is very uncomfortable to play and can't even customize touch controls.,1
Love it,5
"You know the game is good, but you better fired the person who is Managing the rewards in this game, Nobody loves him everyone wants more rewards like starrail! give us 30 limited banner wishes at every version like starrail!!! give us custom artifact maker like starrail!!!!! Also remove TCG! nobody loves that game! nobody plays that thing!! And give us a better and good free five star!!!! Aloy is garbage! She is like 3 star character! If you want to give a five star then giveGenshinCharacter!",1
It's a nice open world rpg game in anime theme with it's graphics in a high peak quality. I just wish that it's have an keyboard controller too for tablet users who use mouse and keyboard.,5

"Love the animation, graphics, design, story line..... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",5
"Game is good tbh,hot characters. I think the rewards are very unfair much to hsr, if I were to be honest though Genshins' plot and storyline is better than Honkai Star Rail. Everything at Genshin impact literally takes over Honkai Star Rail,the thing is it's the rewards that don't take Genshin over Hsr. It's really unfair for Hoyoverse to give less rewards to the game that actually helped the company. Although at least Genshin has no racist character unlike some character Hsr named ""Sparke""...Ew",4
Pls make its size small and optimize it,2
"Absolutely in love with the fontaine archon quest and lore!! It's my favorite archon quest since finishing it and I enjoyed it thoroughly, there's things i'm still discovering in monstadt at AR 45 and still so much to do!! Thank you hoyoverse for the cat petting event!😼",5
"Can't retrieve my account, customer service is trash they don't care about hacked and scam account they only care is money",1
Kikir impact,1
"I think I can highly recommend this game if you're the sort of person who's not taken in by mobile pay to win predatory monetization schemes. All of that is here but there's a surprisingly good game here if you can resist that. Lots to explore, beautiful environments and decent story line -if a bit over written.",4
Game kikir,1
NICE GEME,4
Amazing game love it all people giving 1star should know that you are getting rewards even after not playing for 1 year .,1
"Hi mihoyo if you're reading this im rating it on my cellphone not on my ps4 cause i dont know how anyways back to topic, mihoyo can you pls give me yanfei on my roll cause when i roll 30 i get 2 barbar and 1 xingqiu and not a single yanfei appeared on my screen such a unlucky day it didn't give me it but how rare is yanfei actually is????",4
This game is so good and i love how the animation and the character styles!,5
"I am lost in it !! Beautiful experience, but do improve more!",5
The game is so good.In our country this game is not so popular but some people are play this game and all off them said that the game is so good.,5
Good game,5
It's a fun adventure,4
For me genshin impact is one of the best open world game that I played,5
Not f2p friendly,1
you can't play with your friends because your task is not completed please remove this process,1
"Too grindy, too time consuming doesn't even give that much rewards for your time. 1 hour grind for a half summon? Hell nah💀",1
Give more endgame content And GIVE MORE REWARDS FOR US!!!!!!!!,1
Wow nice game,5
I love this game,5
very beautiful game but his recourse are so slow to fix pls I request,5
GREAT GAME,5
What's wrong with this game? This game soooo selfish with giving mobile players 5 star characters. It's ridiculous i can't even level up the way i want to. As a good looking game your just gonna be TRAPPED in a world with monsters that are stronger than you.,2
I like the game so much But my phone couldn't handle the storage i wish that you could maybe just give us a right amount so That many people could download the app,4
"Now,I've been playing genshin for a while now, for about 3 weeks and 4 days.I have this idea in my mind and it kills me not to ask this to you. Why does characters with ya know, elements, cool elements in fact,but why do they get damaged by their own elements? Like, my point is why not make them immune to their own elements or just make the damage absorbed less critical if the enemy has the same element as the character?Don't hate me, i just want to express my idea good luck for your development",5
Noice 👍🏻,5
"My First review was (23 Sept 2022) and the second one was (11 Feb 2023), and now is (16 April 2024) overall was so good but collecting the good artifact, the talent material, and character exp material got a very little maybe upgrade the amount of how much we can get for level 55+?? But again everything was already good still ✨Recommended ✨",5
The game is very good because the game gets updated every month with new characters and features.The story is very good but after reaching end game it becomes a bet boring but it can be solved by doing story quest spiral abyss and etc..,5
Hoyo give me neuve pls. Advance birthday gift for me. I love this game so much. It's the only game I am playing. Hope I win neuve. Huhu. Up! I GOT NEUVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!,5
"Great exploration, characters, and unskippable dialog. The third is a nitpick I can work around but prefer we can skip",5
"This game is nice although it's laggy on low end phones,Now that I have a better one I'm having the best experience. Keep the good work up!",5
The game takes more data to download. In nigeria here we don't free wifi so we use courier data to browse and download stuff,3
"The game is soo good the animations, stories i like it",5
"Game is alright at first, looks nice n all. Story is okay most of the time. however gameplay gets stale way too fast and grinding makes my brain rot. Wouldn't recommend for anyone who isn't a gambling addict and actually enjoys unique forms of fun.",2
I love it so much 😍,5
"hadeh ni game makin gajelas dari dulu gitu2 aja gaada perkembangan, udah mah semua serba gacha bukan char yang gw maksud tapi artefak ni game bukan mekaniknya yang susah tapi build charnya itu ga pasti statnya gacha, udah gitu pingnya tinggi mulu, padahal wifi gw dipake main game lain enak2 aja mentang2 masih dapet banyak pendapatan dan gaada saingan kualitasnya ga diperbaiki hadeh hoyopers hoyopers",1
"plss, gimme c3 wanderer and his weapon 😔🕯️💙",5
"Its a great open world, love how they managed a full size console game squeezed into a mobile",5
Right I have enough storage on my device and every time I go on the game its saying I dont have enough storage to install the game!!!! This needs sorting,2
Best graphics game in mobile,5
"This the one of the best rpg game I've ever played, I like the scenery,story and game mechanic, play it for a long time now and I wish genshin mobile can support keyboard and mice like other games (I'm sorry for my English)",5
Too demanding,4
It's just masterpiece. Thank you for all developers and workers.,5
"Used to play a LOT in my PS4, but some time ago, when furina's banner came out and I got her, I noticed how boring, tiring, and annoying it is to develop characters in this game, and after doing it over and over with all of my other characters I decided to quit, I finally uninstalled and said ""no more"". Gachas stole my sanity (with genshin I was playing 3 gachas at the same time which means HELL).",2
"Amzing game, have a really good character design and story line, i would recommend it to my friend 👍",5
"If your a amateur in open world gaming.then this is Best game in my opinion. Excellent story,graphics and play style",5

I like This app bcuz it's fun,5

"Ignore the gacha part, this game considers top one open world game in mobile.",3

"My genshin App keeps stopping, why?",1
Love this game,5
Perfect.,5
"Overall semuanya bagus, animasi, story, grafik, dsb. Walaupun emang bener bener ngabisin memori tapi ni game emg bener bener seru, bisa dapet temen, ketemu husbu/waifu kalian, dan bisa menikmati beberapa pemandangan yang cakep di game ini, cuman untuk yg hapenya kentang kayaknya kurang cocok, hp kalian bakal lebih cepet panas dan rusak, walaupun emang ada versi cloud nya, itu butuh makan waktu cukup lama, kalo main game ini mending nikmatin storynya aja si, segitu aja, makasi kazuha nya🙏",5
Good,5
It's a good game,5
"its good i download this game on all devices, buuuuuuttt i got a problem i download resourses on this game, and it takes 1 gb per minute when i download and when it was 60% it said insuffisient storage but i was confused because my device has alot of storage so im not sure if its my device problem or genshin problem im not blaming genshin or anything would recommend if you have 60 gb free.",5
I've been playing this for maybe 7 or 6 months and it was so nice playing this.,5
Its a great game overall but the tartaglia boss fight keeps on glitching and bugging to the point the boss fight dorsnt even load,3
I'm in love with this game. So casual and enjoyable!! Would love to recommend this game to everyone!! ✨,5
Nice game,5
Yeah,5
this is so trash i dont even get 5 star i have no five star the game only gives 5 stars to the streamer or youtuber that plaus genshin and i am on ar 56 and i dont even have a single 5 star ! trash,1
"Very detailed, and surprisingly fun",5
Great Game and stories,4

"The later in the game you get, the more there is to do. Old players will complain about not enough to do, however starting now would give you endless amounts of stuff to do, places to see, people to meet, it's a wonderful game. Especially if you like open world. However it's huge in storage on mobile.",4
Not going to lie it's more funner than honka star rail cuz I just needed to do taxes in the outside world and the other one it just needed to do so much taxes in the space,4
Dev don't care about android player controller support is not available is a shame for a game like this in 2024. wuthering wave has it at the release people will quit genshin me to.,1
"Toxic community, genshin fans bullied voice actor due to her character being bad for gameplay wise.",1
"Invalidating characters and mechanics: Zhongli's shield becomming meta for one patch, just to release the new shield bypassing poison. How many enemies are even affected by Venti? There should be studies comparing statistics on mental health of the players before and after playing this. The primary revenue generation method is fomo. It is impossible to get everything in the game as much of the content and story has been stripped and removed as events come and go.",1
Good,5
Good visuql good storyline but bad at the downloaing,5

"Amazing game but today the game keeps crashing when I open it because of some sort of bug that my phone can't remove. I've trying to open it but I can't, HOYOVERSE please help",5
that's a good game tbh. but this game is just so addictive which kinda affects my studies and stuffs like aaa i just want to keep playing this song but also want to have a normal life but you can be a normal person after playing this game so basically this game is too good and i would like to keep playing this😭,3
Super gaming experience,5
Council quality game for Android thanks this game for launch Android,5
Best game,5
Very good and this game have so much detail and so beautiful places and their skin is better and this game has so much character in school detail and this game has any we have to ki language,5
"It's a fun game and all, but every time I play it on mobile, it keeps crashing and it gets annoying, plus the storage is too much to download, even on laptop. Maybe update it to where it'll stop crashing on mobile and not add in a lot of GB.",4
What a fantastic game.Graphics are superb.For this game i will give 100 stars rating.,5
SO MARVELOUS!!!!!! 😊😍😊 My kids love it so much I love it too and it looks fun 😁,5

This game really good. I have been playing for 2 Years. But the problem is there isn't any support for gamepad controller. I hope they will add this option too. Overall this game is really good worth playing.,4

Best open world mobile game!!,5
No new content repeating events and boring quest which are too lengthy to complete with little rewards too much grinding,1
I like this game♥️,5
❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
It died tho a lot of people play it,1
It's a good game. But they should add more things like a skip button for dialogs :(,5
Please bring the 120fps support for Android. I am getting only 60fps in game. My mobile can support 120fps.,4
Not enough rewards compared to another games......,1
The greatest of all time RPG,5
Yes its the best game,5
i love everything about the game make me addicted to gambling 🤣,4
The app is amazing but their customer service is not. I've written them an email in December about my hacked account and I still didn't receive a reply back.,2
I love this game but to bad i can't add friend in asia server my friend in asia server,4
I like this game and the graphic is so beautiful,5
First of all the story line is not bad and the graphics is pretty good the game has a smooth feeling to it and offers great exploration since it's open world and I like the puzzles you find around the world and each area has it's own mechanisms and features that differs from the others and if I had to point what I like the most about it the beautiful world and puzzles there are to uncover the explanation is the best factor of this game and I love it.,4
"Fun ""pls give me free rolls kinda broke:///""",5
I really like the gameplay and all the stuff especially the characters you can. Gamble all you want but it takes time BUTTT it's still a very good game!! 5 star for sure ( give me furina ),5
"I like the setup and the way it plays, but I stopped playing for 2 weeks, and it logged me out . Every time I log in, it restarted my progress. 4 months of progress gone.",4
"Sadly me with no money have no more time left hopes for the future, the game takes too much storage and the dev's had no idea how to solve the issue.",3
Nice 💯,5
Better anniversary rewards,5

Love it 😽,3
"i love this game so much that i even bought a phone that's compatible for this game. but as someone who's busy with work, the unskipable cutscene is so annoying. please make it possible to skip it. i got no time to listen to the boring storyline. i just want to play",2
"THIS IS JS AMAZINGG, i luv the details and all but the gravity of the womens anatomy was just...yk but anw its amazing and good!",5
Game is good but I can't get any 5 star characters for free. And primogems are very costly . After spending money it's still very difficult to get 5 star characters and still i am mot getting any 5 star character after almost 30 pulls of 10 wish,2
"Spent like $100 and didn't get a 5-star.... Terrible rates, boring game.",1
"Awesome game but i logged out a few days ago and now its no longer letting me log back in (i put in my details it loads for a moment and then nothing happens and takes me back to the login screen) ive tried logging in other accounts and its not working for them aswell, im honestly so upset i dont want to have to start a whole new account",3
"flop, trash pity system",1
Would be better if the developers actually listened to their community..,3
This game is great but it’s take to much storage and this game need a high and device low and device cant handle the game,5
"ill keep this short 1) Bad Artifact grinding. theres 3 layers of RNG. hoping to get the artefact set you want, the stat and substat, and finally hoping it rolls into the substat you want it to 2) bad rewards and gacha system. even hoyos other games have proven to have better gacha system with more rewards for players to earn each patch 3) lack of endgame content. Abyss is the only meaningful endgame content, there is virtually nothing to do if you've 100% all regions and done all quests",1
"Deleted instantly after the Kagura Adjustment Patch. You call it adjustment, we see it as a nerf, we wanted more escaping capability and more DMG because she's clearly weak and useless against other heroes. You had a chance to become the best PVP game and yet failed. She was the only main reason why I started playing and now she's useless. Please change the adjustment and make my money worth it💜",1
"I have been playing since Eula's first banner and getting characters was very fun. I heard many people call genshin bad, but I think that Genshin is amazing. Genshin has made a lot of progress since I think 2020 or 2021.",5
So cool music and amazing open world game,5
"Right now, I'm not able to play genshin because it has a ""bug"" that the developer needs to fix.",3
"I love this game, it makes me want to peel my skin off and eat bugs",5
Good,4
Really this game was forget me to play free fire,5
"The game is really good.The graphics, visuals and music are great. The game gets a little boring after ar55 but with the coop option or with friends it's never boring.The vast amount of characters also makes me want to play more. Thank you Hoyoverse for this beautiful experience.",5

It was great and a lot of fun i enjoy play it when my studies done also when i have a free time.,5

Amazing game good graphics the game takes up alot of space but it has to for a game with such good grapics,5
"Dear genshin community, we all know this is a wonderful app and definitely worth the time and storage because of the beautiful art style, characters, plot, and scenery. With all that being said, AHEM GENSHIN PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER TO GET 5 STARS!!! I started playing a year ago just for one character, arataki itto. AND BEEN PLAYING FOR 12 HOURS STRAIGHT TRYING TO GET HIM. So let this warn you. You are not guaranteed your favorite character >:( unless you spend all your life on genshin.",4
U BETTER BRING ARLECCHINO HOME!!!!♥️♥️♥️,5
really cool,5
Good graphic,5
Game is good,5
Good game ping high 400 ping,1
"At the end of certain quests I have encountered opponents that are far beyond the level your characters are supposed to be at to defeat, and have been continually unable to complete major questlines because of it. A quest that requires characters to be at party level 20 and you end up facing creatures that are five times your level. I have been trying to complete an Archon quest and can not even get a single attack off on the main bosses of the boss battles at the end of it. This is constant.",2
I would give it a five star but it is so laggy I always have to see reconnecting to server and it's getting annoying so can you give me an update pls,4
I CANT GET MY ACCOUNT BACK THATS WHY I STOPPED PLAYING.,1
I love the game I think the game creates did a really good job.,5
"If you don't like having fun, Genshin is perfect. Featuring a ""**** you"" system, but we call it pulling! Don't have enough primogems to lose your next 50/50? No problem! Just wait for the next banner change for a new event, that way we make sure you never get your desired character, unless you pay money! I loved this game personally, it's just like smoking, I gave up several days of my life just for that next hit of dopamine.",2
It's a really bad game it's very glitchy and only works with THE BEST internet.,1
Good game 🥰,3
"It seems like an awesome game but it takes up soooooo much storage I had to delete so many things for nothing! I couldn't find a helpful video to fix it, pls make it use less storage space, if you don't have much storage space I do not recommend this",1
"my rating is still the same. ye, hoyoverse did delete my acc once, but now im playing on europe (ar 53) and started playing on asia 2 days ago (ar 20) and i remembered how fun and beautiful genshin is🫶",5
takes to much storage ;( I always wanted to play it i''m not forcing at all but I reccomend that it takes a bit less of storage you don't have to but have a great day?night p.s:genshin impact is better then Roblox I played on my moms phone,1
The game is good but can you give us a more primogems,1
"Hate The game Hate the Ads Takes up too much storage. I hate the Cringey ""FeAsT YoUr eYeS WaTcH AnD LeArN"" and the worst of all You can't skip the ad. I don't even consider you a game and fighting and getting new characters Are WORTHLESS. You're like fortnite but Worse and Fortnite is already Bad I would see my self out the game. Goodbye, You're game Sucks.",1
"This is a very good game but the thing that hits my mind all the time is that the text "" worship statue"". Please change the text. It's a 5 star review but the only thing that changes my mind is mentioned above.",3
Good,4
I love you all,5
This game is really characteristic and really fun to play,5
"Deserves more than five star🫰🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐1. The graphics, quality and events are great 😖💓 2. The characters are very, very beautiful 😭😭 please keep up the amazing work and I wish you success always 🫰🏻🌸 I love Genshin Impact 🌸😭🫰🏻💓🍃❄️",5
It's super fun! I love it♡ the characters are indeed pretty and their powers are so unique. I started playing yesterday and I'm obsessed still waiting to get more characters tho 😄,5
One of the best game in the world 🌍🌎,5
It's a pretty interesting as well as good game but its storage is too much,3
Jabaridast 💓😉 . I like it . 30 GB game,5
Nice game,4
"I love this game. Its awesome. Absolutely fantastic. From the lore, backstories and music, it all too freaking amazing. They really spend so much time and effort into writing the storyline, and makes you feel part of the game. The devs are really awesome. . . . And then you got the marketing team tryna make you spend ur life savings, but just spend as a last resort.",5
I've only gust got past the 1st cutseen,5
The best game ever😃🙂,5
"I personally dont recommend the game. At first, yes its good, but as you get closer to end you start to notice that devs doesn't care about their player base and there is nothing to do if you are not a tryhard, and ut has very and by that i mean VERY bad gacha system (basically casino). Would recommend if you dont have much time on games",1
"I love the game and the update but my phone does not have space for it so i have to delete it but its ok i highly recommend this, its a beautiful game try it..",5
"It was great, the adventure and all.. but please be reminded that everytime u play this game, u need to record it in case u lost your account or got hacked. I lost my account and apparently someone else have it, linked to their email and password and i tried to get it back and emailed the hoyoverse... But they said i cannot get them back but I'm already in ar 56.",1
"Good but the only thing to do is grind. Grind missions. If your stuck on a mission, you grind levels and stuff. Want a new character? GRIND",4
"Okay game. if you miss ur abusive ex or something like that, then 100% recommend, the devs will care about you even less then (s)he did.",2
Best game evrr,5
I just started on 25 December 2023 and since then I've been obsessed with this game. I always thought it would be boring or something but no the storyline and characters are completely different from what I imagined!! I've been in love with this game ever since and love the quality but I would love to have more chances of wishing for characters since hsr has a hit more features but still everything is perfect or how I see it so 4 stars❤,4
Good,4
"Been playing since launch and to me, there's literally nothing to be hyped for except the new characters. It's getting stale and it has been like this ever since Sumeru. Story progression is too slow. Storytelling is just plain bad and full of uneccesary dialogues you'll fall asleep when reading. TCG that no one cares about. QoL updates that takes ages to implement. Most ingame mechanics are just there to stretch your game time but are boring and annoying. SA is the only endgame.. List goes on.",2
Terribly boring,1
Genshin could never.,1
"It's a great game but if you're like me who's been playing for like 2 years, it gets boring not to mention Hoyo's reward system too, it really is beautiful game the characters are amazing but soon enough farming, fighting and doing it all over again feels like a chore that has to be completed continously just for new characters and it goes on and on...",2
Love ittttt ❤️,5
even with a brand new phone with absolutely NO DATA IN IT it wouldn't install,1
it would not let me play,1
kerenn bangett,5
"Passionate game good music and visual, very heartwarming and colourful events. Epic gameplay. Lots of puzzles some even too hard may take hours but good for brains.. so win win. Low amount of energy for dungeons. Very low percentage on artifact generating crit numbers. Elemental cups almost non existent may take months to find. Lot of characters to play. Choose ur waifus or husband and wiggle around the continent. Map is enormous could get some mounts for faster movement. But very fun to play.",5
"First of all, this is the best game I've ever played. The story is very long and still in development, the events have various options. The graphics are on a different level. So if anybody writes a review about how they like it but gives 1 star, then cry about the lag, get a better device. If you can't, then it's not meant for you to play, sorry. The lag is because of the quality of the game, the developers are going for quality. It's not their fault that the game can't run on a hairdryer. <3",5

It is a good game .. i like it a lot .. but the thing is .. i am playing in my android .. and hopefully .. they will grant us our wish that we can play in our controller like i phone does ..,3
"Player since day 1. Was fun to start, logged in daily. Now I barely log in at all. The motivation to explore is nearly gone. There's no challenge modes aside from the abyss. It's just too repetitive. The writing, mainly voiced cutscenes and character animations, can be jarring at times and ruins the immersion. Like most games, feedback you give is useless. There still is no controller support for Android. It's been years now. Compared to Star Rail, this feels like you get less for more.",3
I like it very much but when we get in the water area where the water god is I don't know what the element is called but the main problem is that when I go out to swim in other areas in the reason why I am telling this is because I already lost my other account so when I go to swim in another area I can't so fix that and we can swim in any area that has water please,1
It is amazing and Stories are also amazing,5
It's really bad to download the resources .,1
It's a pretty good game ever. I don't know what to say. You should try it if you like collecting waifus . There are some bugs here and there and endgame kinda eh but I give it 5 star,5
This game is so cool!! But plss fix the lag issues,5
I am INLOVE WITH THIS GAME! It's so cool! Keep up the good work guys!,5

"Well developed game. However, not F2P friendly.",4
Үнэн гоё тоглоом шүү,5
It took me a while to level up but it was really fun,4
WE WANT KEYBOARD AND MOUSE SUPPORT PLEASE,5
spent so much money yet I still don't get heroes in wish. this is the worst game ever,1
"From the first time I played this game, everything seems fun and I enjoy the game so much. But lately, the game got so large it takes a lot of storage. The problem is also with the developers. They're not listening to their player feedbacks and the rewards nowadays kinda sucks. It's not worth it",1
The update doesn't load?,1
This loading game takes too long and I think it's best if u guys shorten it :>,3
Customer service not good doesn't even reply back I lost my account and I tried to recover my account by contacting the customer service for the recovery form but no reply whatsoever,4
Hey genshin I need wishes can you give me 100 wishe i have lost my 50 50 and I don't have money on me to top up,5
plsss fix the downloading resources very slow downloading 😒😒,4
No feedback,5
"This game is genuinely good. Please ignore the fandom, play the game like a normal human being and i guarantee your adventure in Teyvat will be as peaceful as the wind lead (haha)",5
PLEASE LET LYNEY AND NILOU COME HOME. LET NILOU GET HER RERUN IN 4.7 THE BLOOM QUEEN DESERVES IT ANDDD SHE HASN'T HAD A RERUN SINCE 3.6,5
ARLECCHINO BANNER?! WHEN?! (4.6),5
I like the game but doing quests feels like only dialogue there should be option to skip dialogue,2
Just free,5
Wow super duper cool,5
So fun i even get qiqi fast!,5
"art is amazing, game play amazing, characters amazing. Love it 🤍🤍",5
"Reason I changed my review from 5 star to a 2 star is because ever since the sumeru update I keep on crashing and yes my settings are set to the Lowest and I have a lot of storage left. This is frustrating since I can't even complete a single commission without crashing at least 20 times, please fix this quick it hurts my patience each time I see this game now. Please fix.",1
The graphics are so pretty and the storylines really good,5
This is a Good Game with Several Influences from our Real World.,5
ALLECHINO WILL BE MINE.,5
I like the game!!!😆,5
Love it,5
"Started playing this for the first time ever a few days ago and I'm absolutely hooked. I'm playing this on max graphics on the samsung galaxy fold 5 and it's simply amazing with the screen folded out. Controls are so easy to use, the graphics are incredible and the open world gives me countless hours of playback. I'm playing this at every opportunity I get and I've not touched another game on my phone since I got this. The last time I got hooked to a game like this was when skyrim came out.",5
Is awesome is great the design is very cool and it acts like a very good anime games my only problem is that on mobile it lasts a lot and sometimes it won't even let me play other than that it's a good game.,5
I was unable to download the game with plenty of storage. Not sure why it won't download. Videos are no help.,5
"Make the AR ascensions easier, giving us 2 minutes to finish the quest is t enough, make the enemies weaker or give us more time.",1
made my phone blow up. 1 star for Android.,1
i like it :),5
need a special optimization for tablets like Xiaomi pad 6 the game runs awful on it,1
Genshin Impact mobile Cannot use ps4 controller why? i like this game but disappointed.,1
When the screen is done loading it suddenly makes me leave the app😐🤦,2
I really like it,5
"Genshin Impact has so far been very fun! It has a lot of cool unique creators to play and it is made for all types of players. In it you can hunt, explore,gather,fight enemies and do quests. The world is very very big so you will never get bored and even when you finish the game there is still so much to do and explore.",5
Masterpiece game,5
"good explorations, just add more free primos events, thats all",5
it is AMAZING,5
Beautiful to play because she is happy,5
I am stuck with the loading screen 🙄,1
bad,1
So far I like it. It's absolutely beautiful. Lots to do. Can pick it up and put down easily. Interesting story. Perfect for me and my interest.,5
"the gameplay is well done and the characters have an interesting story too, the music is suuuuper good so it deserves to be played. :)) then the customer help is always super nice ♡ however it would also be good for you to fix the physics in the body of the girls lol",1
It's fun,5
Its aight,4
"Its a very fun game, it is important to have storage space and a good device for the best experience, I also loved tha story line",5
Good game,5
The game got bug but i hope i can play again,5
It's a very fun game to play with friends and family,5
THE WHORST GACHA SESTYM EVER.,1
"Pretty cool, I see",5
"Use good story writers on every story, get rid of paimon, condense data so every update isn't like 100gbs",2
PLEASE ADD AN AUTO-LOOT-COLLECT BUTTON!!!! Tired of having to smash the ⬛ on my PS5 controller repeatedly for collecting drops!,4
"How are people playing this game! I swear I have 10 GB of storage, which is half my entire storage space, and it still can't even download the resources. Like bruh",1
"Playing GI very exhausted sometimes. Grinding sht, daily sht, and losing gacha. And then i saw how u, hoyoverse, handle the critics like that. I feel like sht that always expect new features. Lv100, 200resin, extension abyss floor, etc. It seems like, what u, hoyoverse care rn is marketing new characters and gain big profit. New Patch just to keep player dont runaway. And mostly boring.",1
Pengembangnya kikir saya tidak suka,1
"Over a year this game become boring to me because of when you finish all of the story quest, explored the map, open all the chest etc. I wish that they always release a new archon quest in every update so us who play this don't get bored especially ar60 players",4
I hope it takes a little less space then it does.,4
As a free to play player it's a bit troubling knowing there are other people who can pay there way thru the game but it's really easy to stay invested and play for hours and I was at somepoint someone who thought this game was stupid but now I relise him fun and how much time I can put into this game.,4
"Genshin Impact, hailed for its visuals and gameplay, falls short due to its predatory gacha system, lack of meaningful endgame content, restrictive resin system, shallow storytelling, limited multiplayer features, performance issues, and profit-driven monetization. The game's emphasis on expensive microtransactions, repetitive tasks, and unfulfilling narrative arcs creates a pay-to-win environment, fosters player burnout, and fails to deliver a truly immersive and satisfying gaming experience.",1
GREAT APP.,5
Easily the absolute best mobile game ever. Everything about this game is so amazing. The story is decent I would say. It has a very big map and u can explore Soo much also it is open world. U don't exactly need money to play this game u can play it without paying at all like me. There is however a major issue that is the ping pls hoyo create a better server for Asia we need more asian servers it is always above 170- 300 even though my wi fi is rly good. Pls this game would be perfect with that.,5
It was soooooo fun,5
"This game could be pretty fun but so many downsides in the game... Such as the excessive amount of storage, the underwhelming lack of endgame content, the bad wishing system and artifact system, how difficult it is to level up your characters, and the overall lack of content. It seems good at first then it just feels like it's not enough, and the requests made by players that still aren't introduced like more resin, skip button, more QoL updates etc. It's unlikely but I hope they listen to us.",1
Idk I just like it,5
👍👍,5
This is a overall good game but the main prob is getting primos and I like it make me sometime feel bad for not getting anything and doing so much hard work and the daily commission is like doing daily homework it make me stressed,4
"Trash enemies can stop you in the middle of attacks but you can't stop them. World Leveling makes enemies stronger than you and in many cases unkillable. No way to change difficulty until reaching world 5, but you don't have powerful characters or equipment to survive. Bosses also summons enemies that you can't reach. Are you guys for real? Caps character level but makes enemies 10+ level stronger? Recommended level for dungeon bosses is false. If you have no money, don't play this game.",1
"Loved it. There were a few silly bugs, but they were fixed. The story is good, and the character designs are even better",5
"This game gives me depression.The graphics are ok,but it's really hard to get to level 20 or 30 to continue the main story.Kinda dissapointing....and it makes me cry,i love the charackters so much,but the chances to get them are REALLY low....",1
Excellent game,5
"Its very fun to play even though its quite sad, im happy that genshin exist:]",5
Game kikir ygy,1
😭😭 I have a 64gb phone bro please,5
This game is so amazing 😍,5
Mihoyo just listen to the people that made you what you are today....,1
good,5
It is so it hard to play if i'm going to level up kuki shinobu i need to go in inazuma but you need to fight child and its hard,1
"AR 58, 21 five star character with only 2 50/50 win in a lifetime and 1 early ? Meanwhile others getting 7/9 50/50 win a row with early ones . Damnn i may be the most unlucky person in the universe who still tries to play this after this heartbreaking insult . I give up.",1
"Imma keep it a buck, this kids game has a lot of pedophiles playing it",2
"its aesthetic game i love it ofcourse but only counter is that it cannot handle it if i am using 4G or 5G network it keeps crashing in 5minutes even with low settings and good phone as it says, I hope you developers of MiHoyo or HoyoVerse can fix the perfomace on Android issues for the rest i like it",5
very awesome,5
"this game is the best!! I main scara and he's so good! They are so much to explore, but mostly, I like to spend my primogems => I recommend u to download this game and see for yourself",5
Its so good,5
I like it but it's so hard to get a 5 star,5
The best game that I've played💯,5
"Well, to be honest I can't even play the game, Ill try more but I tried to make up a username and a password and used my own, I was pressing register now and I went to my gmail to see what the pin was and it reset my game so I had to do the process over and over but it kept closing me out. I don't know if this happeneds with other devices or it was just me. But the game looked really pretty on the screen I was in so ill give it a 3..",3
genshimnb (i never played it on my phone),4
Some missions are very hard and need the right timing should be a missions skip option,5
this game storyline is good,5
"I accidentally deleted this game, I literally wait for minutes, so I log in my gmail and i was expecting my old account but INSTEAD the game created me a new account, bring my account back it took me weeks just to level up and I can't lose it!",1
Kikir impact,1
"Never playing any hoyo games again. I don't have any luck in my pulls as a free to play, which hoyo hates to see, yes a f2p. Broke 2 phones while playing this game from overheating and 1 PC. Not playing any hoyo games anymore.",1
It's really good game,5
I give this a 5 star I have been playing this game for 3 months and I have heard a lot of comments abt how the game has dissatisfying rewards and let me tell you these rewards are very helpfull in the future and can be used in various ways I actully love to meet new characters and unlocking domains and getting on higher ar (adventure rank) and thank you for keeping this game free 👍👍💕💕☺️☺️☺️,5
Bad 😞 game,1
game burik banget,1
"It's a very good game,I love it but can I add competitive multiplayer,I like playing 1vor 1v2 or etc pls adding it will improve the game and can u allow on co-op mode, we can continue story quest pls.",5
Спасибо за письма ;),1
Rewards are too low,1
Wonderful game but nothing,4
Bad rewards compared to the time you have to waste to get it,1
Cool game,5
WUTHERING WAVES NATION ARISE!,1
It says insufficient storage every time 😡,1
"This game makes my brain rot (10/10, fully recomend)",5
Beautiful,5
"I love the game, the Graphics and the gameplay is so good, but they should really increase the amount of awards you can get. I understand you can get rewards by exploration and events but with the amount of new characters it is really challenging to get a character that you want.",3
Cool,5
How about not showing co-op teammate 2P badge on the map when they are in angel's share bar or any houses available in co-op. This way we can play hide n sneak with co-op teammates,5
This game has the best cut scene and this should be the top grossing in adventure literally not kidding it's so good,5
Its really my game i love rpj and adventure and the charactars are all amazing,5
Im 20 and my 18 yeat old son loves the game.,5
The reason why it's 3 star it's because the game gets really boring if you progress the story and play it all the time and there's no content to make the content its all looping but I love the characters the abilities I love the skills its really fun game but the reason for 3 stars because of the rewards and boring content.,3
This is an amazing game...,5
It take lots Of time to open,1
Bro I have to wait for this to get this MB load already its somewhere 29.000 and 30.000 megabytes I hate this,1
"Editing my review since uh it's been a year.. I really love this game sm and I think the ONLY thing that I'm really having a hard time is getting primos and wishing on banners cuz I'm really freaking unlucky😭 But overall everything's great. THE LORE IS THE BEST ‼️‼️‼️‼️ VERY VERY INTERESTING. The character designs are good too I love it sm 🥹 And abt the graphics, it's quite fine for me cuz my phone can handle high graphics (I LOVE THE DETAILS SO MUCHBTOO)",5
"PLIS KASIH PRIMOGEMS LEBIH BANYAK, JANGAN JADI GAME KIKIR PLIS, AKU MW FATHER 😭😭😭😭😭 I WILL DO ANYTHING😭",5

😊,5
At some point in the downloading process it just stop 1500-3000 mb I already have the amount of space And the required wifi but it just slows down the downloading speed for no reason it only happens on mobile data,1
"Awesome i love it theres alot of quest and things to explore you can also fly,swim,climb it has aton experience",5
"The customer service is filled with bots rejecting the account recovery forms, it took me 2 years to get my account back without the help of mihoyo customer service. Really sad they try to minimise costs in such important field",1
This game is good everything.What I would like to suggest is that adding more languages would be better.,4
Sehat sehat game baik,4
THE BEST GAME EVER,5
Good game,5
Don't waste your time. If you haven't played before don't bother starting now.,1
game kikir tapi cinta🥰,5
could the redemption codes NOT EXPIRE AFTER 5 MINUTES,1
"This game has a TON to offer! However, it is gae af. Your choices mean little and their answers match what the story wants. I wanted to be a menace and do my own free world exploring, but the game makes you follow the story. On the bright side a kid wanted me to feed some geese and I killed them all after throwing down the food and he recognized it. If you want a pg story with some cutsy high pitch voices then this is for you. Game is good, but very much follow the script. Worth a shot",4
Very cool!,5
Good,5
This game so good but my luck so bad that's why I giving 2 star pls increase my luck rate i not get yet 5 Star I'm 30 ad lvl I see al players got 5 in Start or randomly pls :v fix,2
Amazing!!,5
Yeah,4
Getting bored,3
This game sucks,1
